# 0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while
## About
An introductory project on:
- arithmetic operators and how to use them
- logical operators (boolean operators) and how to use them
- relational operators and how to use them
- What values are considered TRUE and FALSE in C
- How to declare variables
- How to affect values to variables
- How to use the `if`, `if ... else` statements
- How to print the values of variables with `printf`
- How to use the `while` loop
- What is the `ASCII` character set
- The purpose of the `gcc` flags `-m32` and `-m64`
## Requirements
- Ubuntu 14.04
- gcc 4.8.4
## File Descriptions
### Mandatory
**[0-positive_or_negative.c](0-positive_or_negative.c)** - assigns a random number to the variable `n` each time it is executed. Prints whether the number stored in the variable `n` is positive or negative.

**[1-last_digit.c](1-last_digit.c)** - assigns a random number to the variable `n` each time it is executed. Prints whether the last digit of the number stored in the variable `n` is greater than 5, 0, or less than 6 and not 0.

**[2-print_alphabet.c](2-print_alphabet.c)** - prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line, using `putchar`.

**[3-print_alphabets.c](3-print_alphabets.c)** - prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line, using `putchar`.

**[4-print_alphabt.c](4-print_alphabt.c)** - prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line, except the letters `q` and `e` using `putchar`.

**[5-print_numbers.c](5-print_numbers.c)** - prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.

**[6-print_numberz.c](6-print_numberz.c)** - prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line, using `putchar`, without using a variable of type `char`.

**[7-print_tebahpla.c](7-print_tebahpla.c)** - prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line, using `putchar`.

**[8-print_base16.c](8-print_base16.c)** - prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line, using `putchar`.

**[9-print_comb.c](9-print_comb.c)** - prints all single-digit numbers, separated by a comma, using `putchar`, without using a variable of type `char`.

**[10-print_comb2.c](10-print_comb2.c)** - prints the numbers from 00 to 99, separated by a comma, using `putchar`, without using a variable of type `char`.
